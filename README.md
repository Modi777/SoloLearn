About Bonus Comparator
=====================
https://code.sololearn.com/WfpY4zqBx9yk

Compare two codes (Bonus) side by side.

The Bonus program has been written in different languages, so that they can be compared 
to each other.
The functionality of codes in the SameSame section is exactly the same. In the Different 
section it is different and codes cannot be compared really. Codes in the External section 
cannot be executed on SoloLearn.
